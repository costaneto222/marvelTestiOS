# Marvel iOS App Curriculum
This project is a curriculum of all my knowledge on iOS/Swift.

Here I use some libs to help deal with some iOS stuffs.

## cocoapods-keys
I use this lib, to make keep a safe record of Marvel Api Keys outside my project. This is important too guaranty that other developers can't get access to my private keys.

## RxSwift + RxCocoa
I frequently use this libs, because they help me a lot and make my code more descritive.

## Quick & Nimble
I really like this libs, because they make our unit tests more readable and easy to understand.
